     <h3>Operational Bottlenecks & Revenue Constraints (AdventureWorks)</h3>

          width="800">

     <p><em>
        End-to-end BI case study analyzing how demand volatility, production bottlenecks,
        and quality issues contribute to revenue loss.
     </em></p>

     <p>
        In this project, I used SQL Server and Power BI to analyze how sales demand,
        production performance, and quality metrics interact in a manufacturing setting.
        The focus was on identifying operational bottlenecks that limit revenue growth,
        rather than looking at sales or operations in isolation.
     </p>

     <p><strong>Key focus areas:</strong></p>
     <ul>
        <li>Sales demand trends and revenue concentration</li>
        <li>Production cycle time, scrap rate, and efficiency</li>
        <li>Underproduction of high-demand items relative to safety stock</li>
     </ul>

     <p><strong>Skills & Tools:</strong>
        SQL Server (SSMS), Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling, Operations Analytics
     </p>

    <h3>Social Media Sentiment Analysis (Tableau)</h3>

     alt="Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard Overview"
     width="800">
 <p><em>
    Interactive Tableau dashboard exploring engagement and sentiment trends
    across Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook (2010–2023).
  </em></p>

  <p>
    Social media data is noisy and emotional, and it’s often hard to tell what people
    actually feel, where engagement is coming from, and how this differs across platforms.
    In this project, I explored how sentiment and engagement behave over time across
    Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and whether clear patterns emerge that could inform
    content or communication strategy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked with a dataset of 732 social media posts spanning 2010–2023 and classified
    posts into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. Using Tableau, I built a multi-page
    dashboard combining KPIs, sentiment distributions, long-term trends, platform comparisons,
    geographic sentiment mapping, engagement breakdowns by sentiment, and time-of-day analysis.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Key insights:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Positive sentiment dominates overall and consistently drives higher engagement (especially on Instagram).</li>
    <li>Twitter shows a higher share of negative sentiment, aligning with more critical/complaint-oriented expression.</li>
    <li>Engagement varies strongly by timing, with afternoons and evenings showing the highest interaction.</li>
    <li>Emotion-level signals (e.g., joy, excitement, gratitude) add nuance beyond simple polarity labels.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Dashboard strengths:</strong></p>
  <ul>
     <li>Brings together sentiment and engagement data to show how emotions translate into user interaction.</li>
     <li>Breaks insights down by platform (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook), making it easy to compare how sentiment behaves across channels.</li>
     <li>Uses time-based analysis to reveal long-term patterns as well as short-term engagement spikes.</li>
     <li>Goes beyond simple positive and negative labels by incorporating geographic and emotion-level perspectives.</li>
     <li>Designed to be interactive, allowing users to explore sentiment by platform, time, location, and engagement in a flexible way.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Skills & Tools:</strong>
    Tableau, Sentiment Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
    Data Visualization, Time Series Analysis, Data Storytelling

    <h3>Connected World: Global Internet Usage Trends (Tableau)</h3>
    <img src="assets/images/internet_usage_overview.png"
       alt="Global Internet Usage Trends Dashboard Overview"
       width="800">
    <p><em>
      Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing global internet usage
      and adoption trends over time.
    </em></p>
    <p>
     This project explores how internet access has expanded globally over time,
     focusing on differences in adoption levels across countries and regions.
     Using country-level internet usage data, the dashboard combines geographic
     visualization and time-series analysis to reveal both global trends and
     country-specific adoption paths.
    </p>

   <p><strong>Main findings:</strong></p>
   <ul>
      <li>Global internet usage has increased rapidly, but growth remains uneven across regions.</li>
      <li>A small group of countries has reached near-universal adoption, while many remain far below.</li>
      <li>Early adopters show rapid growth followed by saturation, whereas late adopters follow slower and more uneven trajectories.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Dashboard strengths:</strong></p>
   <ul>
      <li>Clear visual hierarchy that guides users from global KPIs to country-level trends.</li>
      <li>Effective use of geographic mapping to highlight digital divides across regions.</li>
      <li>Interactive filtering that enables seamless exploration from a global overview to individual country trajectories.</li>
      <li>Combination of map and time-series views to compare both adoption levels and adoption paths.</li>
      <li>Designed for exploratory analysis, encouraging users to ask and answer their own questions.</li>
   </ul>

   <p><strong>Skills & Tools:</strong>
      Tableau, Geographic Visualization, Time-Series Analysis,
      Interactive Dashboards, Data Storytelling
