    Interactive Tableau dashboard exploring engagement and sentiment trends
    across Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook (2010–2023).
  </em></p>

  <p>
    Social media data is noisy and emotional, and it’s often hard to tell what people
    actually feel, where engagement is coming from, and how this differs across platforms.
    In this project, I explored how sentiment and engagement behave over time across
    Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and whether clear patterns emerge that could inform
    content or communication strategy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked with a dataset of 732 social media posts spanning 2010–2023 and classified
    posts into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. Using Tableau, I built a multi-page
    dashboard combining KPIs, sentiment distributions, long-term trends, platform comparisons,
    geographic sentiment mapping, engagement breakdowns by sentiment, and time-of-day analysis.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Key insights:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Positive sentiment dominates overall and consistently drives higher engagement (especially on Instagram).</li>
    <li>Twitter shows a higher share of negative sentiment, aligning with more critical/complaint-oriented expression.</li>
    <li>Engagement varies strongly by timing, with afternoons and evenings showing the highest interaction.</li>
    <li>Emotion-level signals (e.g., joy, excitement, gratitude) add nuance beyond simple polarity labels.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Connected World: Global Internet Usage Trends (Tableau)</h3>

       width="800">
    <p><em>
      Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing global internet usage
      and adoption trends over time.
    </em></p>
    <p>
     This project explores how internet access has expanded globally over time,
     focusing on differences in adoption levels across countries and regions.
     Using country-level internet usage data, the dashboard combines geographic
     visualization and time-series analysis to reveal both global trends and
     country-specific adoption paths.
    </p>

   <p><strong>Main findings:</strong></p>
   <ul>
      <li>Global internet usage has increased rapidly, but growth remains uneven across regions.</li>
      <li>A small group of countries has reached near-universal adoption, while many remain far below.</li>
      <li>Early adopters show rapid growth followed by saturation, whereas late adopters follow slower and more uneven trajectories.</li>
   </ul>

   <p><strong>Skills & Tools:</strong>

      Interactive Dashboards, Data Storytelling
